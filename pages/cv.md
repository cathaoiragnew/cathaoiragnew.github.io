**<u>Summary</u>**

Ph.D. in Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning, specializing in Computer Vision, with hands-on experience in developing real-world AI solutions. Throughout my 3-year Ph.D., I
contributed significantly in launching two AI products in collaboration with an industry partner, from conception to deployment, while also publishing six peer-reviewed articles
(four as first author). Skilled in translating academic insights into practical applications, utilising advanced deep learning techniques to solve complex business problems.
Passionate about driving innovation and eager to contribute to high-impact AI projects while continuously expanding my technical expertise.

**<u>Experience</u>**

**Machine Learning Engineer**
Akara | Feb 2025 - Present
- Transform thermal video data into actionable computer vision systems, enabling real-time event detection, activity recognition and object tracking in critical environments such as operating rooms.
- Drive end-to-end development of machine learning models, from dataset creation and preprocessing to training, fine-tuning and deployment on embedded edge devices.
- Build automated and scalable ML infrastructure using AWS SageMaker, streamlining dataset preprocessing and training pipelines.
- Explore and prototype multiple use cases of thermal imaging technology, establishing the foundation for scalable deployment and market adoption.


**Computer Vision Researcher**
University of Limerick | Sept 2021 - Jan 2025
- Conducted extensive research on the impact of ground truth annotation quality on computer vision performance, resulting in significant insights published in scholarly journals.
- Mentored and supervised summer interns, enhancing their understanding of machine learning principles while fostering a collaborative and supportive research environment.
- Delivered comprehensive instruction on machine learning and deep learning principles, managed computer laboratories and virtual learning platforms and assisted students in
identifying and resolving coding issues.
- <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=gZgIYMoAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank" style="color:blue; text-decoration: underline;">Published and co-authored six peer-reviewed publications during my PhD</a>, contributing to the academic knowledge base in the field.


**Computer Vision Engineer**
University of Limerick | Sept 2021 - Sept 2023
- Collaborated with an industry partner as part of my PhD to conceptualise and develop their first AI system, <a href="https://www.amcsgroup.com/solutions/amcs-vision-ai/" target="_blank" style="color:blue; text-decoration: underline;">Vision AI</a>, which automated previously manual processes in container overfill and contamination detection.
- Worked closely with multidisciplinary teams to define data requirements and align project goals, ensuring clear communication to meet their needs and expectations
throughout the process.
- Trained and deployed the models on Azure Machine Learning Studio, facilitating cloud-based solutions for model deployment and production.
- Achieved 80% mean Average Precision (mAP) on automated overfill container detection and 40% mAP on contamination detection - results published in peer-reviewed journals.
- Applied and researched cutting-edge computer vision techniques to optimise performance, ensuring the final product met both the industry partner's operational needs and
quality standards.

**Data Scientist**
Fiserv | June 2021 - Sept 2021
- Analysed financial transaction data using SQL to identify key trends and insights, optimising transaction acceptance rates.
- Developed interactive Tableau dashboards to visualise findings and communicate results to business stakeholders, enabling data-driven decision-making.
