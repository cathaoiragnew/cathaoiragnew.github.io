title: Overfill Detection
---

In collaboration with an Industry partner, we conceptualised and transformed the initial idea of using computer vision to automate the detection of overfilled bins into a fully functional product. 

The work undertaken from this project encopess the entire work process for a computer vision product, from data curation, cleaning and model development and deployment on Azure Machine Leanring.
