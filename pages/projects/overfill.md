title: Overfill Detection
---

In collaboration with an industry partner, we conceptualized and transformed the initial idea of using computer vision to automate the detection of overfilled bins into a fully functional product.

This project covered the entire process of developing a computer vision solution, including data curation, data cleaning, model development, and deployment on Azure Machine Learning studio. The video below gives a brief overview of the product.
