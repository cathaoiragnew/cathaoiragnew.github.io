### Outside of Work
When I'm not working, you'll often find me training for sports, primarily [hurling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurling) and [handball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaelic_handball) (both traditional Irish sports). I also enjoy hiking and attending concerts and comedy gigs. These activities keep me active and balanced, allowing me to recharge and return to my professional life with renewed energy and focus.
